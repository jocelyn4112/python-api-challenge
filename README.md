API Homework

Please note, I have added a Word file with screen shots of the Google maps for "VacationPy" in that folder. Applicable graphs are in a folder withthe same name. Thanks!

Weather Observations:

1) On the whole, latitude and humidity have little relation to latitude, while temperature, logically, does. 
2) Maximum temperature decreases and latitude increase. 
3) Though a weaker correlation, humidity increases in conjunction with latitude. 
4) Humidity and latitude have little correlation with cloudiness having even less correlation.
